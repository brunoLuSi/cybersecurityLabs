    "This activity aims to **familiarize yourself with the use of Shodan’s and Censys’ functions**\n",
    "to search for devices connected to the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this task, first, you need to **create an account** on either Shodan\n",
    "(https://www.shodan.io) or **Censys** (https://censys.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created an account on either platform, you can start using the **search engine**\n",
    "**for exposed devices and services on the Internet**, exploring detailed information such as\n",
    "IP addresses, open ports, software versions, and other security-relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the questions using either search engine. At the beginning of this section, you must\n",
    "specify which of the two search engines you are using for this practice, as you cannot switch\n",
    "between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type ”Amazon” and then press the Enter key. How many results did you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, look at the additional information displayed on the left side of the search engine.\n",
    "Your search results are categorized into different sections. You can click on any of\n",
    "them to refine your search. How many results, if any, are there for the location Spain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let’s continue exploring the categories section on both platforms. If you look closely,\n",
    "you will see that both pages share a section called **”TOP PORTS”**. In each case,\n",
    "which port has the highest number of results, and what is the count?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now that you have a basic understanding of how the search engine works, let’s use the queries offered by both platforms. Depending on which scanner you are using, enter the following query in the search bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Censys: host.location.city=\"Madrid\"\n",
    "    - Shodan: city=\"Madrid\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    How many results did you get in your scanner?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If you check the **”TOP COUNTRIES”** section in the sidebar, you will notice that\n",
    "even though Spain appears at the top, there are other cities named Madrid in different\n",
    "parts of the world. To refine our search further, let’s specify the country along with the\n",
    "city. Use the following queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Censys: (host.location.city=”Madrid”) and host.location.country=”Spain”\n",
    "    - Shodan: city:”Madrid” country:”ES”\n",
    "\n",
    "    How many results did you get in your scanner ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After exploring these examples of how the search engine works, let’s take advantage\n",
    "of its features and perform a deeper search on a specific IP address to examine the\n",
    "available information. Enter the following IP in the search bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Censys i Shodan: ip:”84.88.66.162”\n",
    "\n",
    "    In **Shodan**, click on the first result that appears. In **Censys**, it should take you directly\n",
    "to the result page; if not, follow the same step as in Shodan. Once inside, you will\n",
    "see a lot of information, much of which may be unfamiliar. Let’s focus on the basics.\n",
    "**Which ports are open on this IP, and what protocol does each one use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you look closely, you will see that both port **25 and 587** are open and use the same\n",
    "protocol. Investigate the possible reason why each port might serve a different function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Have you detected any vulnerabilities in the previous exercise? If so, specify which\n",
    "vulnerability or vulnerabilities were detected, on which ports, and explain what each\n",
    "one means in your own words. (For this question, you must use Shodan, as it is not\n",
    "possible with Censys)."

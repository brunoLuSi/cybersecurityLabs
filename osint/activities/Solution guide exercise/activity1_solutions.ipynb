    "- Traditionally, port 25 is intended to be used for communication between email servers, although it was also used for sending clients but many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) blocked it in order to prevent spam. On the other hand, port 587 is the one designated for sending emails from clients as it requires authentication and supports a type of encryption called STARTTLS, offering a secure transmission and aligned with security practices.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The CVE-2015-4000 vulnerability: In general, this vulnerability allowed an attacker to access and manipulate data in compromised TLS connections. At the time, the TLS protocol had a vulnerability known as \"Logjam\", which could allow an attacker to intercept sensitive information. This occurred when a system did not properly handle an encryption option called DHE_EXPORT. The attacker could intercept this information from a man-in-the-middle attack in order to degrade the connection to a weak 512-bit encryption. If he managed to gain access, the attacker could recover the session key and modify the content of the traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vulnerability CVE-2015-0204: OpenSSL clients accepted weak ciphers, called EXPORT-grade, even if they were not requested. This allowed attackers to intercept the connection through a *man-in-the-middle* attack and thus force the server to use this weak cipher. With this type of cipher, the attacker could easily decrypt the communication between the client and the server.\n"
